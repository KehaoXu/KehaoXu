- Achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of around 4 on the validation dataset through model fine-tuning
-->

🔹 **[End-to-End 3D Scene Reconstruction from Images](https://github.com/Wayne0758/Computer-Vision.git)**  
<!--
- Implemented a full pipeline from automatic feature matching (SPSG, SIFT, etc) to 3D sparse point cloud generation
- Estimated camera parameters using SfM and rendered the reconstructed scene via NeRF
-->

🔹 **[Frog Call Classification](https://github.com/KehaoXu/Optimization.git)**
